# 👋 Namaste!

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am Satyam Tiwari, and this space is dedicated to showcasing my coding journey. 🌟

## 🌐 About this Repository
In this repository, you will find my very first "Hello World" programs in the following programming languages:

- 🌐 C

Each "Hello World" program marks the beginning of my exploration into these languages and is a testament to my passion for coding. 🚀
